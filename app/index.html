                Evidence indicates that counselling in schools can underpin academic achievement, improve behaviour and concentration as
                well as improving the general well-being of the children. The counselling sessions are around 45 minutes
                long and progress will be reviewed after 6 sessions. We welcome feedback from staff, parents and of course
